## Features

### 1. Profile Image Upload
- **Location**: Edit Profile page (`/edit-profile`)
- **File Types**: JPG, PNG, GIF
- **Size Limit**: 5MB maximum
- **Storage**: Files are stored in `public/uploads/profiles/`
- **Naming**: Files are named with user ID and timestamp for uniqueness

### 2. Real-time Updates
